    "Ans:The main differences between logging and print statements in Python are:\n",

    "Output Stream: print sends its output to the standard output stream (stdout), whereas logging sends its output to a variety of destinations (e.g., file, console, network) based on the logging configuration.\n",

    "Flexibility: logging provides different log levels, loggers, and handlers, allowing fine-grained control over what to log and where to log it. print statements, on the other hand, are simple and do not offer such configurability.\n",

    "Log Levels: Logging allows you to categorize log messages based on their severity, which is crucial for identifying and dealing with issues at different levels of importance. print statements are just meant for simple debugging and don't offer such differentiation.\n",

    "In real-world applications, it is generally better to use logging over print statements because:\n",
