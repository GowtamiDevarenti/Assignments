    "#1.What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a program. OOP enables the organization of code into objects, which are instances of classes. These objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to a specific entity. The key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction."

    "In Python, an object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete representation of the class, created from the class blueprint. Each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions using its methods. Objects allow us to work with specific instances of data and behavior defined by the class."
